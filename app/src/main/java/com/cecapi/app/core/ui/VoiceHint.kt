 * Makes a control explain itself out loud, for people who cannot see it:

 * - [help]: said when the finger stays pressed on it, to say what it is and what it does;
 * - [onHold]: also called when the finger stays pressed (used to light up the card that was held).
 * The press is only observed, never consumed, so a tap still does exactly what it did before.
